#### Rules for Creating/Amending Documents
##### General Rules
- Use our official branding only. Found [here](https://github.com/flybywiresim/fbw-branding).
- Use easy to see and pleasing colours to substitute in areas where official branding doesn't match. Good website for colors can be found [here](https://flatuicolors.com/).
- Use good punctuation and grammar where possible.
- Check for spelling errors.

##### Fonts
- It is recommended to base the fonts on researches for aviation. [Here](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/adegani/Flight-Deck_Documentation.pdf) is a study from Nasa on the subject.
